# **Is it possible to stay in AirBnB's top-rated homes or in Seattle's best neighborhoods without spending big bucks?**

## **Project motivation**
This analysis has been carried out using a Kaggle dataset with the objective of understanding how AirBnb works in Seattle and with the idea of showing that, due to the pricing strategies of each of the hosts, a person can stay in the best rated homes on AirBnB without making a large outlay.

## **Installations**

Several quick start options are available:
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- Otherwise you can directly use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

## **Files description**

- **analysis_seattle_airbnb_def.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook where you can consult  the code used to perform the analysis.
- **calender_seattle.csv**: CSV file with the information of the daily price of each house and its availability
- **listing_seattle.csv**: This CSV file contains information about each of the houses of AirBnB in Seattle. This information is related to the house's name, a summary of the house, the neighbourhood, information about the host, house's location, the offered service, house type, prices, conditions of the renting, review scores and more information


## **Interaction with the project**
The best way to interact with this analysis is to download the [CSV files](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) described above and the .ypnb file and open them in any program that allows it. In this way you will be able to check the veracity and accuracy of the results obtained.
